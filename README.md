# Rapidez Multiple Wishlist

## Installation
```
composer require rapidez/multiple-wishlists
```

It's not recommended to publish every view, rather you should overwrite only the files necessary. However, you can still publish all of the views with the following command:
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Rapidez\MultipleWishlist\MultipleWishlistServiceProvider" --tag=views
```

You also should probably add a new "wishlists" button to the Rapidez account menu, if you use it in your project (which is in `rapidez/account/resources/views/partials/menu.blade.php`)

## API endpoints
The API uses mostly Laravel apiResource endpoints. All of the exposed endpoints can be found below. Note that every request except for `GET /wishlists/shared/{token}` requires a bearer token header for authorization. This is the magento oauth token of the customer.
